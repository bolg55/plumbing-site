|[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)| Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override. |
|[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) | TypeScript is an open-source language that builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions. It provides highly productive development tools for JavaScript IDEs and practices, like static checking. TypeScript code is transformed into JavaScript code via the TypeScript compiler or Babel.|
|[React](https://react.dev/)| Used where site requires client-side functionality, such as mobile menu, dynamic gallery etc.|
