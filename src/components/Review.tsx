      Last year, Elmira's sewage was backing up into our basement, but Adam came and saved the day! He not only fixed the immediate issue (sewage everywhere), but got to the root of the problem quickly and explained everything to us along the way. He made sure to stay until everything was fixed and cleaned up, and his prices were still below other quotes we received! We'll definitely call him back for future plumbing needs (just hoping it's not more sewage)!
