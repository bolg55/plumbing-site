Maintaining your home's plumbing system can help prevent major issues down the line. Here is a basic checklist to guide your routine maintenance.

## 1. Check for leaks.

Regularly inspect faucets, showerheads, and pipes for leaks. Even minor drips can lead to significant water waste and potential damage.

## 2. Test the water pressure.

Low water pressure can be a sign of a leak, clog, or issue with your water heater. Consider purchasing a water pressure gauge for regular checks.

## 3. Inspect your water heater.

Look for signs of corrosion or leaks. Ensure the temperature setting is no higher than 120 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent scalding and energy waste.

## 4. Clean showerhead and faucet aerators.

Over time, mineral deposits can build up and reduce water flow. Soak them in vinegar to help dissolve the deposits.

## 5. Check exposed pipes and appliances for water leaks.

This includes pipes under sinks, the water heater, washing machine hoses, and refrigerator if it has a water dispenser or ice maker.

## 6. Flush out your water heater.

This helps reduce sediment build-up which can lower the efficiency of your water heater.

## 7. Check toilet for leaks.

A leaking toilet can waste a large amount of water. Add a few drops of food coloring to the tank. If the color shows up in the bowl after 30 minutes, you have a leak.

## 8. Clean your garbage disposal.

Regularly cleaning your garbage disposal can help prevent clogs and keep it smelling fresh.
