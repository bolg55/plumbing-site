Understanding your home's plumbing can save you time, money, and potential headaches. Here are some essential plumbing tips for conserving water, maintaining your plumbing system, and tackling common issues.

## Water Conservation Tips

### Fix leaks promptly.

Even a small leak can waste a significant amount of water over time.

### Install water-saving fixtures.

Consider low-flow faucets, showerheads, and dual-flush toilets.

### Use your dishwasher.

It often uses less water than washing dishes by hand.

### Collect rainwater.

Use it to water your garden, wash your car, or clean your outdoor spaces.

### Don't let the tap run.

Turn off the faucet while brushing your teeth or shaving.

## Plumbing Maintenance Tips

### Know where your main water shutoff valve is located.

This is essential in case of a major leak or plumbing emergency.

### Never pour grease or oil down your drain.

These substances can solidify and cause clogs.

### Avoid using chemical drain cleaners.

They can damage your pipes. Instead, try a plunger or a plumber's snake.

### Insulate your pipes.

This can prevent them from freezing in the winter.

### Schedule regular maintenance.

Regular inspections can help identify potential issues before they become major problems.

## Tips for Common Plumbing Issues

### Clogged Drain.

Use a plunger or a hand auger to unclog a drain. Avoid using chemical drain cleaners as they can corrode pipes.

### Running Toilet.

This is often caused by a faulty flapper or fill valve. Both are relatively easy and inexpensive to replace.

### Low Water Pressure.

This could be due to mineral build-up in your faucet or showerhead. Remove the aerator or showerhead and soak it in vinegar overnight.

### Leaky Faucet.

This is often caused by a worn-out washer. Turn off the water supply before attempting to replace it.

### Garbage Disposal Jam.

Never use your hands to clear a jam. Instead, use pliers or a hex key to turn the impeller.

_These tips can help you maintain your home's plumbing system and deal with common issues. However, some problems require professional help. Don't hesitate to call [Cooper & Adlys](/contact) for your plumbing needs._
