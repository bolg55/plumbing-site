Understanding the basics of your home's plumbing system can help you manage minor repairs and identify when to call in professionals like Cooper & Adlys. Here's a beginner's guide to get you started.

## Water Supply System

Your home's water supply system brings in fresh water from a municipal source or private well. The main shutoff valve, typically located near where the water line enters your home, allows you to turn off the water supply during repairs or emergencies.

## Drain-Waste-Vent System

This system removes wastewater from your home. It consists of drain pipes, waste pipes, vent pipes, and trap fittings. Vent pipes prevent sewer gases from entering your home, while trap fittings block sewer gases and prevent clogs.

## Kitchen Plumbing

Kitchen plumbing includes water supply lines for sinks and dishwashers, drain pipes, and often a gas supply line for a gas range. Garbage disposal units, if present, are also part of the kitchen plumbing system.

## Bathroom Plumbing

Bathroom plumbing is more complex, including water supply lines and drain-waste-vent systems for sinks, showers, bathtubs, and toilets. In many homes, the bathroom has the most concentrated plumbing setup.

## Basement or Utility Room

This area often houses water heaters, washing machines, and sometimes a utility sink or a sump pump. These elements also have associated water supply lines and drains.

_This guide provides a basic overview of residential plumbing systems. Remember, always consult with a professional plumber like [Cooper & Adlys](/contact) for major repairs or installations to ensure safe and effective operation._
